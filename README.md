Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning project that uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. The project utilizes the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to perform the classification task. This README provides an overview of the project, dataset, dependencies, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and results.
Dataset

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset used in this project is a widely recognized dataset . The dataset contains the following attributes:

    Features (10 attributes): Various measurements 

    Target Variable (1 attribute): Binary classification, where '2' represents benign tumors and '4' represents malignant tumors.

The dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data.
Dependencies

Before running the project, you need to install the following Python libraries and packages:

    NumPy
    Pandas
    Scikit-Learn
    Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-knn.git](https://github.com/gpradeepkumar98/KNN

Change to the project directory:

bash

    cd breast-cancer-knn

    Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

Usage

    Open the Jupyter Notebook KNN.ipynb to explore the project.

    Follow the code in the notebook to load and preprocess the dataset, train the KNN classifier, and evaluate its performance.

    Feel free to modify hyperparameters, try different distance metrics, or experiment with feature selection to improve the model's accuracy.

    Document your findings, experiments, and results in the notebook.

Results

The project aims to achieve accurate classification of breast cancer tumors using K-nearest neighbors. The results, including model performance metrics and visualizations, can be found in the Jupyter Notebook Breast_Cancer_KNN.ipynb.
